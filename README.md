This compiler is not complete: only contains lexer and parser.
Java syntax specification is reduced.

* To run the program you need to run "Main.java" in "src/runner".
* You can find the grammer in "info" directory
* The test file can be found in "resources" directory as "Test.java". You can replace or edit this file to see the desired result. The inputs of both lexer and parser will be this file.
* The parser WILL NOT stop at errors.
* The implementation of parser is of "Recursive Descent" type.
* There is a GUI implemented with intention to ease the visualization of parsing and lexing.
